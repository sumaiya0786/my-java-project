**Starter skeleton for the Programming in Java Project 1.**
Generated on 2025-09-24.

## What this archive contains
A ready-to-edit Java project skeleton implementing the required package layout, sample domain classes, services, IO placeholders, README and test-data for quick start.

## How to use
1. Unzip the project.
2. Open in Eclipse or your preferred IDE as an existing Java project.
3. Add your implementation to the `src/edu/ccrm` packages.
4. Run the application by executing the main method in edu.ccrm.cli.MainMenu.

## Project structure (important files)
- `src/edu/ccrm/cli/MainMenu.java` — CLI entrypoint (main).
- `src/edu/ccrm/domain/` — domain classes (Person, Student, Course, Enrollment, enums).
- `src/edu/ccrm/service/` — service interfaces & simple in-memory implementations.
- `src/edu/ccrm/io/` — Import/Export and Backup service skeletons (NIO.2).
- `src/edu/ccrm/config/` — AppConfig (Singleton) example.
- `test-data/` — sample CSVs for import.
- `USAGE.md` — quick commands and sample import steps.

## Notes & next steps
- This is a skeleton to help you complete the assignment faster. Replace TODOs with full logic.
- Make sure to enable assertions when testing: `java -ea -jar ...` or enable in run config.
- Add screenshots to `screenshots/` as you test.

## Academic integrity
Use this skeleton as a starting point and implement the logic .
